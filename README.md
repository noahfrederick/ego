# Ego

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ego.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ego)

Ego is a personal command-line assistant that provides a flexible, natural
language interface (sort of) for interacting with other programs. Think of
it as a single-user IRC bot that can be extended with handlers for various
natural-language queries.

## Installation

Ego requires Ruby. If you already have Ruby installed, run:

    $ gem install ego

## Usage

Ego responds to natural-language queries at the command-line:

    $ ego what can you do?

If you want to interact with ego as a REPL, try:

    $ ego --shell

## Extending

Ego does very few things out of the box, but it's designed to be extensible!
You can personalize ego and teach it to do new things by defining plug-ins,
which are small scripts that tell ego what queries to listen for and how to
respond to them and can even add entirely new features. Here's what a plug-in
looks like that responds to a query beginning with "hello...", "hi...", or
"hey..." with its own random greeting:

```ruby
Ego.plugin do |robot|
  robot.can 'greet you'

  robot.on /^(hello|hi|hey)/i, 3 do
    say [
      'Hello.',
      'Hi.',
      'Ciao.',
    ].sample
  end
end
```

    $ ego hello
    > Hi.

Let's break that down:

```ruby
robot.can 'greet you'
```

This adds a new "capability", which serves as documentation for the user and
answers the question "What can this plug-in do?"

```ruby
robot.on /^(hello|hi|hey)/i, 3 ...
```

This is the condition that determines what queries should invoke the following
action. The first argument is a regular expression to match the query against.
Sometimes you may want to match very specific things and sometimes something
broader. To help ego respond the right way when two or more patterns match
your query, you can optionally specify a priority (higher number = higher
priority) as the second argument.

```ruby
... do
  say [
    'Hello.',
    'Hi.',
    'Ciao.',
  ].sample
end
```

This is the part that gets run when the pattern matches the query. From here
you can do anything you want including deferring to external programs. The
`robot` provides various methods to you to respond to the user. Usually, you'll
want to make use of part of the query inside the action. You can access named
match groups through the optional `params` parameter:

```ruby
Ego.plugin do |robot|
  robot.can 'repeat what you say'

  robot.on /^say (?<input>.+)/i do |params|
    say params[:input]
  end
end
```

Try it out (this one is already included):

    $ ego say something
    > something

Ego looks for user-defined plug-ins in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ego/plugins/`
(that's `~/.config/ego/plugins/` by default), and registers them
automatically at runtime. Each plug-in goes in it's own file with an `.rb`
extension (e.g., `~/.config/ego/plugins/my_plugin.rb`). Be carefulâ€”ego will
execute any Ruby scripts in this directory indiscriminately.
